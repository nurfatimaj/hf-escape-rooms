Fatima's impressions:

-   there is a puzzle that requires immense precision (lose a lot of time)
-   some clues are not super intuitive (easy to get stuck thinking it is solved one way, but turns out it is solved differently)

```{r}
library(leaflet)

leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addProviderTiles('Esri.WorldGrayCanvas') %>% 
  addMarkers(lng = rmarkdown::metadata$long, 
             lat = rmarkdown::metadata$lat)
```
